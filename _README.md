Inspired by https://tests.radically.digital/tests/fullstack-tech-test

Setup:

I'll include 3 mp3 files in a public github repo (free to use files / cc4.0)
I'll have 3 album covers in b64 encoding

I'll have the above data in a json blob to emulate an api [{ url: "", image: "", name: "" }]

I'll have basic styling from https://picocss.com/

I'll have a basic react app setup

Tasks:

make a fetch request to the api to get the albums and songs (5-10mins)

play the song (10-15mins)

do some basic styling (its a classless css library so we could ask for the album art or button to be centered) (5mins)

display the album art (5-10mins)
